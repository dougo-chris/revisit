# Software Engineer & Founder

I help companies make more money from their existing software.

I'm a software engineer and founder based in Melbourne, Australia. I build products and systems that solve real problems—and I write about what I learn along the way.

## What I Do

I'm currently the founder of [FolioReady](https://folioready.com), a SaaS platform that helps companies collect documents from their clients. I'm also a Senior Platform Engineer at [InvestorHub](https://investorhub.com/), where I work on large-scale backend systems.

My background is in building companies from the ground up. I was the first employee at Agent Arts, where we built recommendation engines that powered music and video services. The company was acquired by Microsoft, where I continued to grow the technology and team.

Over the past decade, I've worked on large-scale backend systems at Telstra that process millions of records and maintain critical network infrastructure. I combine data analytics skills with software development experience to build applications that scale—both web and server-side.

I'm a hands-on developer who believes in leading by doing. Whether it's architecting a new feature or debugging a production issue, I'm there with my team working through it. I've used my startup experience to help large companies adopt lean and agile processes within their organizations.

## Current Interests

Right now I'm exploring:
- The shift from generative AI to agentic AI and what it means for product builders
- Why "vibe coding" with AI tools might be better than traditional no-code platforms
- How developer teams can effectively support and communicate with customer success teams
- The three phases of startup go-to-market and knowing which phase you're actually in

## What I Think About

I'm fascinated by the intersection of building software and building businesses. My writing explores:

- **AI & Product Development**: The fundamental economics of using tokens to build vs. tokens to run, and what that means for sustainable businesses
- **Go-to-Market Strategy**: How early-stage companies find product-market fit and build repeatable growth systems
- **Developer Practice**: Pragmatic approaches to project structure, tooling, and the craft of writing maintainable code
- **Building in Public**: The realities of creating products that no one knows exist—and figuring out how to change that

I believe the best products come from understanding both the technical constraints and the business context. Code quality matters, but so does talking to customers. System architecture is important, but so is knowing when to ship.

## Get in Touch

I'm always interested in talking with people building products, scaling systems, or navigating the messy intersection of code and business.
