### [90% of the jobs I recruit require an Engineer to have worked with a specific tech stack. | Georgia Hart](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/georgiahartrec_90-of-the-jobs-i-recruit-require-an-engineer-activity-7343121630040084480-dOhf)

90% of the jobs I recruit require an Engineer to have worked with a specific tech stack.

Most Engineering leaders are set on hiring someone with X amount of years in a particular tech stack or language but languages and frameworks evolve (or even disappear!)  

What actually makes an excellent Engineer is their ability to problem-solve, communicate, learn fast, and collaborate (especially in today’s fast-moving, multi-disciplinary environments)

By restricting your hiring to a narrow stack, you could be:
👉 Missing out on brilliant engineers with transferable skills
👉 Slowing down your hiring velocity
👉 Building a team that’s great today, but not so great for tomorrow 
👉 Missing out on Engineers who are passionate about building great products as opposed to being obsessed with using one language

It's safe to say, most engineers know more than one language and they’ve thrived not only because of their tech stack, but because of their attitude and adaptability to continuously learn and adapt. 

If you're hiring for long-term impact, start with soft skills. Hire the person who can learn, unlearn, and grow with your company.

Do you agree?
