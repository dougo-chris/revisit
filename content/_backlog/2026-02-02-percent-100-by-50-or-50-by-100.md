Choose Wisely: 100% of 50% or 50% of 100%

Imagine you have 10 features in your backlog.

Now - in the real world - they’d likely take varying amounts of effort. Some might take a week. Others two or three. But to keep the math simple, let’s assume each feature takes two weeks to complete.

That gives us 20 weeks of total effort.

Fast-forward 10 weeks. You’re halfway through your timeline. Your team(s) could be in one of two dramatically different spots:

Scenarios:
A) 100% complete on 5 features
B) 50% complete on all 10 features

Same investment. Same burned hours. Radically different business outcomes.

Value of "Done"

In Scenario A, you’ve shipped five production-ready features. They’re done, tested, deployed, and users are interacting with them. You can measure their impact.

You’re not "in progress" - you’re in production. Nice!

In Scenario B, you’ve delivered... nothing. Ten partially-built features sit in inventory. Little or no user feedback. No revenue impact. No customer value. Just mounting risk and frustrated stakeholders. Maybe update your resume.

Here’s where it gets interesting.

Economics of Early Delivery

Any one of those five completed features could already be paying dividends:

Savings - A workflow improvement saves 2 hours per employee per day. With 100 employees, that’s $50K/month in recovered productivity.

Revenue - An upsell feature converts 3% of users to premium, adding $25K/month in recurring revenue.

Market - A unique integration helps close three deals for $300K.

Risk - A security enhancement prevents a breach that could cost millions.

That's compelling math. One successful feature might fund the whole program. That’s not just continuous delivery - that’s compound strategy.

Hidden Costs of Half-Done

Those 10 half-built features aren’t neutral - they’re expensive:

Opportunity Cost - Incomplete work devours capacity.

Context Switching - Developers juggling multiple features move slower.

Technical Debt - Partial builds increase testing overhead and fragility.

Stakeholder Confidence - Effort without outcomes erodes trust.

True Agility

Agile doesn’t reward busywork or progress reports. It rewards working software that solves real problems.

Each completed feature is a hypothesis test in production. You learn what users value, how they behave, and what should come next. That feedback loop is impossible when the code’s stuck in dev branches.

Strategic Implementation

The path forward requires discipline:

Prioritize Ruthlessly - Rank by impact, not preference.

Define "Done" Clearly - Include testing, documentation, deployment.

Resist Feature Creep - Log additions as new backlog items.

Celebrate Shipping - Make delivery visible.

Measure Relentlessly - Track outcomes, not just output.

Deliver Outcomes, Not Updates

Half-finished features are luxury expenses. Shipped features are investments that can pay for themselves.

100% of 50% delivers value. 50% of 100% delivers PowerPoint updates.

Choose wisely.
