I've given myself a challenge to write content for this blog every day for 90 days. The content of the blog will be about me building [FolioReady](https://folioready.com) as a solo developer

### It's not about building an audience. It's about learning to be a better communicator.

I work on code, design, sales, and everything else that needs to be done. While not everything will be interesting. It will be about what I'm doing and how I do it.

I've been a software developer for 30 years. I'm always looking into new technologies to make sure I have the relevant skills for today's job market.
Taking notes about what I have learn't is something I've always done. So now it's time to articulate the learnings into something I can share with others.

### What's the worst thing that can happen?

No traffic. But that's what I've got now. As long as I stay true to what I do and what I think all will be fine.

## The Plan

### Create the routine
- Give myself the space and time to write.
- Morning : 30 to 60 minutes to just write.
- Afternoon : Think of things to write about.

### Make it easy to do from everywhere
- TailwindPlus template
- Markdown content

### Better done than perfect
Once a piece of content is written it can be thought of as done. It might not be great, but it's done. It might not be as structured as it should, but it's done.

I know it will be awkward at it, but I'm hoping the more I do the work the better it will become.

### Learn by doing
I've always learnt new things by doing them and getting better over time.

### Don't use AI !!!
AI is great, but while I'm learning to be the author I will write the words. I'm happy to use AI in the research, but not for creating content.
