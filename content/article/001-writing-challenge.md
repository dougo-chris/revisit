## The Plan

### Create the routine
- Give myself the space and time to write.
- Morning : 30 to 60 minutes to just write.
- Afternoon : Think of things to write about.

### Make it easy to do from everywhere
- TailwindPlus template
- Markdown content

### Better done than perfect
Once a piece of content is written it can be thought of as done. It might not be great, but it's done. It might not be as structured as it should, but it's done.

I know it will be awkward at it, but I'm hoping the more I do the work the better it will become.

### Learn by doing
I've always learnt new things by doing them and getting better over time.

### Don't use AI !!!
AI is great, but while I'm learning to be the author. I'm happy to use AI in the research, but when creating content I need to learn how to put together the words and sentences myself.
