I've build [FolioReady.com](https://folioready.com) and it's pretty good, yet no-one knows it exists.

My plan was to build FolioReady with integrations being core to it's feature set. From there I would get listed on other sites as a solution for file uploads. Customers would discover the product and start using it.

I added "Simple Analytics" to my site to see where people are visiting from. The reality is no-one is visiting. It's pretty confronting, but really highlights what's wrong. I have built a product in "stealth" mode. I've not brought anyone along while I create. I've written code and called done, but I've not shared what I've done.

So now I need to revisit my plan and look at ways to get users.

### Forums
There are forums and discord groups where I can talk about what I'm building and ask for feedback.

### Direct contact with ideal customers
Find companies and consultants that build products on the integration partner's platform and ask what they use.

### Blog posts
Create content on the FolioReady.com site. Showcase how it works.

### Integration marketing
Continue to explore how I can be listed on other sites as an integration partner. What I've found is integration approval is really slow. I've been working with one company for over 6 months and I'm still not approved to be listed on their site. But it's still something I have to explore and work through.

### The Ask
It's time to start the "ask".
- Ask people to explain how they are solving this problem now.
- Ask is FolioReady a solution they would pay for?
- Ask for people to trial FolioReady.

If no-one is using it how can you claim it's that good? I've used it myself in different ways to simulate real world use cases, but I'll never know for sure until real users start working with it.
