# Software Engineer & Founder

I'm a seasoned software developer based in Melbourne, Australia.

For the last 5 years I've worked on large scale backend systems that process millions of records and are critical to maintaining network availability.

I'm also the founder of Folioready, a SAAS that help companies get documents from their clients.

Previously I was the first employee for a startup building recommendations engines used by online music and video services. The company was sold to Microsoft where I continued to work for a number of years.

I'm a hands on developer, with startup experience, who leads teams by being with them in doing the work.
